""" What data types can we use in Python? """

# Numbers
# Integers (int): Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3.

# Floating point (float): Numbers with decimal places, such as 1.5, 2.0.

# Complex numbers (complex): Numbers in the form a + bj, where a and b are floats.

# Strings (str): Sequences of characters, such as "Hello, world!".

# Lists (list): Ordered and mutable collections of items, which can be of
# different types, such as [1, 2, 3] or ["a", "b", "c"].

# Tuples (tuple): Ordered and immutable collections of items, such as (1, 2, 3).

# Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique items, such as {1, 2, 3}.

# Dictionaries (dict): Collections of key-value pairs, such as {"name": "John", "age": 30}.

# Booleans (bool): Represent truth values, True or False.

# Objects: In Python, you can create your own classes and objects,
# allowing for the manipulation of complex data.

# Arrays: While lists are commonly used, the NumPy library offers arrays
# that are more efficient for mathematical and scientific operations.

# DataFrames: The Pandas library allows you to work with data tables,
# which are very useful for data analysis.

# How can I check the data type?
my_var = 2
print(type(my_var))
